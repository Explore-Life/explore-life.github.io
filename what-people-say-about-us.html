 Hi Chrissy,&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I want to let you know honestly, how professional I think you act in all you do. You are extremely experienced and efficient, take time and care to provide a client with a trip that suits that persons particular needs. Not many people have the ability to understand the likes and dislikes and needs of many different people. You go to great lengths to secure the best and most economical deals available at the time. You research the various locations to insure the best spot to suit the needs of your clients. <br />&nbsp;<br />I'm most happy with how you look after me and I'm sure this special trip for me is worth every cent! <br />&nbsp;<br />Many thanks<br />Lyall

<div align="left"><em>&nbsp;<br />Christina Lando at Explore Life has organised two of my the most memorable<br />overseas trips. Both were around the world with multiple destinations<br />comprising extended stays in Central America 2007 and the Caribbean in 2003.<br />The Caribbean trip involved island hopping following the Australian Cricket<br />team on its West Indies tour (cricket tragic).<br /><br />Her extensive first hand destination knowledge and outstanding route<br />planning not only saved me money, it allowed me to maximise my time OS and<br />has left me with experiences I will always treasure.<br /><br />David Russo, Clayfield, Brisbane</em></div>

<div align="left">Thank you so very much for providing us with such a wonderful trip. Everything went perfectly!&nbsp; <br />Accommodation was great.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jay was loved everywhere we went, people just wanted to touch his curly blond hair and take photos of him. We discovered that Rhianna has a natural ability to read maps and a great&nbsp;sense of direction. The three kids just loved everything about&nbsp;travelling.<br />People have asked me what my favourite place was and I find it really difficult to answer!<br />So thankyou very much for all your wonderful work and patience, we now just want to go back and spend more time in each one of those cities.<br />&nbsp;<br />Lisa and Peter<br />Brisbane Queensland<br />

<p><em>Thank you for all your help while we were away.&nbsp; The trip was just fantastic and we are keen to go again. We would like to congratulate you.&nbsp; The positions of most of the hotels were so close to the trains etc so it made travelling very smooth.&nbsp; The trip was a huge success and now just have to start saving for the next one.&nbsp; Thanks again Melissa for your help.<br />&nbsp;<br />Brad and Janelle<br />Brisbane, Queensland </em></p>

<p><em>Christina from Explore Life organised my trip of a life time in 2003 to the Caribbean to follow the Australian cricket team with a European stopover on the way home.&nbsp; It was a wonderful experience from beginning to end with everything running like clockwork thanks to Christina's hard work and professionalism.&nbsp; Christina made travelling a totally stress free experience and all with a smile and a laugh. Thanks Explore Life.&nbsp; I will continue to recommend you to my family and friends.</em></p>
