 <div>Christmas present, 2009 - a little computer made booklet from my beloved man announcing that we were going on a holiday - but wait there's more - two holidays!! One to Egypt and Kenya and the other to France. I thought I would burst, but instead, to his confusion, I just burst into tears!! </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Egypt and Kenya&nbsp;are amazing, each in their own right. Sunrise and sunset over the pyramids is extraordinary as is watching hippos and their young dancing heavily&nbsp;in the early morning light in a deep red muddied river while we&nbsp;munched muesli; descending into the story-filled depths of Egyptian tombs, feeling the heat recede and the cold air&nbsp;of deep tombs whisper into your sundrenched skin&nbsp;- sitting in absolute silence watching lions tear flesh from newly killed prey only a few metres away&nbsp;- makes my hair stand on end just to recall the moments.&nbsp; Dining and dancing&nbsp;with new friends from&nbsp;many parts of&nbsp;the world on a paddle steamer as it wends its way down the glorious Nile - dining with our Kenyan guide and hearing his stories as chimps scatter beneath our feet - friendships made and are constantly refreshed by infrequent but regular emails and phone calls - from the giggles of&nbsp;a young&nbsp;maasi girl dressed in vibrant red with hair- adorning bright pink and yellow beads&nbsp;-&nbsp;to the warm handshakes of greeting and meloncholy departure&nbsp;from&nbsp;guides and new friends&nbsp;- a fantasma of stories that only travel can give us. By the way, Egyptians and Kenyans understand the Australian sense of humour - the Kenyans are wonderfully mischievious and the Egyptians just have a wonderful way of enjoying laughter and making fun - funny how home is everywhere you look!!!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>France - there are so many words to describe this dream of a place. (A dream that tourists see and most French do not I am afraid.) A surprise birthday dinner in the famous Jules Verne Restaurant in the Tour d'Eiffel that became a marriage proposal (no I didnt guess a thing), and a wonderful week of celebration travelling around the best of eastern France - Avignon - dinner with the Chef as he demonstrated his craft accompanying it with his vibrant and very funny wit, and the hotel (to be seen to be believed)&nbsp;- to die for - my comment after La Mirande and the Chef of the day&nbsp;was that if I died the next day, I would have no regrets - my heaven on a plate - romance, food, humour, new friendships - bliss. Glad I didn't die because dinner there the next night wa utterly magnificent. Avignon is an unending delight, the next corner always brings more surprises and&nbsp;discoveries - could spend weeks there. Beune - a lovely market and wine town in beautiful countryside, market day was indescribable - the French have an uncanny gift of display - even the potatoes looked glamourous!&nbsp; D'Etoges and the champagne vinyards - mile after mile of vines - kilometres and kilometres of underground tunnels housing hundreds of thousands of dozens of champagne bottles aging quietly and majestically. Romantic dinners, bedrooms in castles, more new friends, lots of happy snaps, take me back pleeeeeeeeeeeeease.!!!!!!!!&nbsp; Aaaah travel - food for the soul, age-defying for the brain and vibrancy for the heart. </div>
