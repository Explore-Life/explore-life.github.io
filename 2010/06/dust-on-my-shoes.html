 <p><p>Peter Pinney's first book <em>Dust on My Shoes</em> is an account of an overland journey which he made between 1948 - 1950 from Greece to Burma via Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan &amp; India.&nbsp; It is now known to Westerners as the Overland Route or Dope Trail.</p>
<p>"I am just travelling. Some people like to grow crops, others to make music, or sit in small shops, like your father, selling pots. I am unsuccessful in all the things which I enjoy most, except the one thing which I find best of all: and that is travelling. To pass through a new country is something very dear to my heart."&nbsp; an excerpt from <em>Dust on My Shoes - Peter Pinney. </em></p>
<p>
<span style="DISPLAY: inline" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px 20px; FLOAT: right" class="mt-image-right" alt="PP.jpg" src="http://www.explorelife.com.au/PP.jpg" width="83" height="94" /></span>Love it! Love it!&nbsp; When I first read this paragraph, I had just plunged in for a warm soak in the tub and had this great book for company.&nbsp; By the time I considered putting the book down, I was frozen, since the water had gone cold and the candlelight had faded away to a dim sliver, and I could no longer see!&nbsp; His words just reached inside my heart &amp; snatched out the adventure that I so longed for.&nbsp; I couldn't get enough of his adventurous &amp; wild&nbsp;encounters on what was&nbsp;at times,&nbsp;a very terrifying journey.&nbsp; I really just wanted to walk in his shoes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Have you ever felt that yearning for adventure where you simply want to <em>scream out loud, as loud as you can! Get me the hell out of&nbsp;here!!!!&nbsp; </em>Where the everyday joys of life with money &amp; security, well, just doesn't do it for you?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our conditioning from society means that our first impression of riches are material items like cars, homes, money &amp; fashion.&nbsp; I am here to tell you along with Peter Pinney [professional traveler, then writer] that nothing moves me quite like a smile from a person,&nbsp;dressed in rags for clothes, most teeth missing, weathered faces &amp; beings which wreak from needing a good shower.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing else&nbsp;matters when we engage our hearts&nbsp;through a smile and try to converse with our hands, since we cannot understand each other!&nbsp; When you constantly throw yourself into experiences like this, it is so damn hard to just settle for less.&nbsp; AND I mean the day to day slog in western society with all our grandeur is&nbsp;<em>less</em> than the riches I gain from a fleeting conversation, a smile or embrace I receive from one country to the next. </p>
<p>I'm not someone who&nbsp;"has&nbsp;money", as such&nbsp;[although, even in my position I&nbsp;would be better off than many]. I feel&nbsp;blessed that I've gained so many amazing exchanges in my life,&nbsp;that this is my wealth.&nbsp; I would have to say, that I am most content &amp; fulfilled when I am travelling.&nbsp; An abundance of more worldliness and wisdom is all I cherish.</p>
<p>I live to travel.&nbsp; It is truly the greatest educator of life!&nbsp; Try topping up&nbsp;your life&nbsp;until it overflows with soulful experiences.&nbsp;When everything around you is cold, the reminiscences will warm you.</p>
<p>Peter Pinney &amp; his wife Estelle settled in&nbsp;Brisbane in the 1980's. He passed away in 1992. Noted here is the website <a href="www.dustonmyshoes.com">Dust on My Shoes </a>however there are a great deal more explorations of his life worth discovering.&nbsp;He is a legend in my eyes.&nbsp; I only wish I had the fortune of meeting with him. </p></p>
